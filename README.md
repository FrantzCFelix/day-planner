# day-planner
Simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.
## Description

User will be presented with a work schedule. This includes hours 9-17(millitary Time), input fields to put work events and buttons to save the events. The input fields will be grey if the slot is in the past, red if it's equal to the current time and green if it's in the future. The work events will persist even if the broswer is refreshed by utilizing the browser's local storage.
